The project entails designing an object counter for a conveyor belt system utilizing the 8051 microcontroller. By integrating infrared sensors strategically positioned along the conveyor belt, the system accurately detects the entry and exit of objects, incrementing or decrementing the count accordingly. This count data is then displayed on a designated unit, providing real-time visibility of the number of objects on the conveyor belt. Through careful circuit design, firmware development, and testing, the project aims to deliver a reliable and efficient solution for automated object counting in industrial settings, facilitating inventory management, production monitoring, and process optimization.
